Use of CNN to classify Xray images into healthy lungs and sick ones.

The 2020 COVID-19 outbreak has prompted for increased research on several aspects of the disease. The diagnosis of pneumonia (one of the primary complications resulting from COVID-19) through imaging techniques and the particular use of artificial intelligence as an ancilary tool has gained special traction as the disease progresses.

Along with physical examination, imaging diagnosis plays a central role in the detection of pneumonia. 
Chest radiographs are frequently used in diagnosis procedures and represent a fast, cost-effective alternative to map the nature, features and extension of lung inflammations. 
X-ray radiograph image opacity areas are commonly correlated to pneumonia affected regions.

Three different datasets of images of lungs X-rays will be used for our analysis, organized into the training, test, and validation dataset.
